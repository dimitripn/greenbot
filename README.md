# 🌱 Greenbot

Greenbot is a tiny GitHub Actions bot that keeps your contribution graph green by planting a random number of “seeds” (commits) every day.

Each day, it:
- Chooses a random number of commits (1–3)
- Appends lines to a `.keepalive` file
- Commits and pushes automatically
- Makes your GitHub garden grow 🌿

> This project is for learning GitHub Actions and automation. Real contributions should still come from real work.

## 📂 How It Works
1. GitHub Actions runs on a daily schedule  
2. It randomly decides how many commits to make  
3. It appends lines into `.keepalive`  
4. It commits and pushes those changes  
5. GitHub updates your contribution graph
